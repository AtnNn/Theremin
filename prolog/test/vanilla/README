The driver for the code is in

vanilla.pl

This (of ocurse probably won't work if your prolog
doesn't conform to the standard.
In fact it doesn't work for four of the five cases that I
have tried.

The following files do work.

For ALS prolog  als_v.pro,  for these you use the als directory
because ALS doesn't (as yet) support current_predicate.

For gnuprolog  gnuprolog_v.pl
For sicstus  sicstus_v.pl


After loading the driver files you then call the goal

run_tests.

The results appear at the console.


A word on errors raised by is/2. The standard is somewhat ambiguous on this. 
Section 7.9.2 of the standard says that evaluation has only one type_error namely evaluable. 
But all the error listings in 9.4.x.3 use integer in their type errors.
Generally I have preferred the former in this version of the suite, 
besides this is consistent with what is done in the rest of clause 9.
However if the argument is evaluable, but not of the required type
eg a float when an integer is expected then one should throw 
type_error(integer, 7.5) so this is what the suite expects.
